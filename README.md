# üó£Ô∏è Text-to-Speech Converter

This is a simple and intuitive desktop application that converts text input into spoken audio. It provides a straightforward interface where users can type or paste text and have it read aloud with a click of a button.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Text Input:** A dedicated text area for typing or pasting any text.
* **Speak Button:** A clear button to initiate the text-to-speech conversion.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and minimalist design for ease of use.

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd text-to-speech-converter
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This application typically relies on a Python text-to-speech library. The most common ones are `pyttsx3` or `gTTS`. If you're using `pyttsx3`, you'll also need a backend speech synthesizer (like `sapi5` on Windows).

    ```bash
    pip install pyttsx3 # Or gTTS, depending on your implementation
    ```
    *Note: If you're on a non-Windows system and using `pyttsx3`, you might need to install `espeak` or `nss` manually.*

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python your_app_file_name.py # Replace 'your_app_file_name.py' with your actual Python script name
    ```
